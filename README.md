ZoneMinder PHP Mail Alert Script

As I could not get ZoneMinders weird email notification features to work (or even to send a single email at all) I gave up and wrote this ugly PHP script. You might need to initialize the zm_event file by typing

<pre>
echo 0 > zm_event
</pre>

I'm going to fix that later. Sure.
